## Discord Web Scraping Bot

Runs locally, enter any product name into with the format of "$search produce name" and the bot will return the price, status, and name of the first 
four entries on the Best Buy product search page. Then the user can select a number indicating which product they are interested in, if the product is
out of stock or unavailable, the bot will retry every 15 minutes until the item is available again, otherwise it will return the products url to be 
purchased.
